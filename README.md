# 8. Uncovering the World's Oldest Businesses

An essential part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions.
In this project, you'll explore data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses. You'll use joining and data manipulation techniques to answer questions about these historic businesses. You'll use the datasets `businesses.csv`, `new_businesses.csv`, `countries.csv`, and `categories.csv` to answer the following questions:
1. What is the oldest business on each continent?
2. How many countries per continent lack data on the oldest businesses?
3. Which business categories are best suited to last many years, and on what continent are they?
